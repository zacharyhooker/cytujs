# Cytube Theme
Because external channel CSS is loaded regardless of if the user has accepted the external JS – this is an attempt to beautify the channel with only CSS. The look is similar to [BillTube’s theme](https://github.com/BillTube/theme), but Bill’s relies heavily on JS. 

• This is extremely hacky. The underlying bootstrap must be overwritten (think !important). As such this should be considered just a proof of concept and not a valid theme. This is not going to be compatible with all browsers; although it should work with the browsers that have access to Cytube’s userscript (namely Firefox and Chrome).
